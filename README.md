# Your Neural Network Library

This is a lightweight neural network library built from scratch using Python and NumPy. It aims to be simple, modular, and extendable for experimenting with deep learning models.

## Features
- Custom layers, activations, and optimizers
- Easily build models like LeNet or fully connected networks
- Example scripts for datasets like MNIST

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-neural-net.git
   cd your-neural-net
2. Install Dependencies
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run examples (TODO)
